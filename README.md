# Weather_Prediction

#in this article, I will train a model to predict weather with machine learning. We will act as if we do not have access to the weather forecast. We have access to a century of historical averages of global temperatures, including global maximum temperatures, global minimum temperatures, and global land and ocean temperatures. Having all this, we know that this is a supervised regression machine learning problem.
